Ah... the amazing hash table, the backbone of much of modern software. Associative arrays, dictionaries, most PHP data structures, are all hash tables behind the scene.

Hash tables combine flexible storage with quick addressing, and handle all of C-R-U-D efficiently and elegantly.

This started as a self learning project to explore the workings of the hashtable.

To run the demo, clone or copy the files, 'make' and './demo'

The code is commented to highlight some important paradigms of hash tables.

Note: Collisions are handled by open adressing / linear probing.
